There are several types of Rewards, allowing players to
raise the effectiveness of their armour, helm, shield or
weapon. Most Rewards (Qualities) may be applied more than once
to the same piece of gear, unless the upgrade is specifically
highlighted as unique.

Each single piece of equipment can receive a maximum of
3 Qualities in total. An item with 1 Quality is considered
to be of fine make, one with 2 Qualities is a superior
piece of equipment, and one with 3 Qualities is an object
of worth.


#### Cunning Make (armour, headpiece or shield)
A skilled craftsman has made this piece of equipment
lighter or less cumbersome than its lesser counterparts,
thus reducing its Encumbrance.

The Encumbrance rating of the selected item is reduced by
2 (to a minimum of 0 Encumbrance).

This upgrade may be applied to any defensive item, and
can be selected multiple times (always up to a maximum
of 3 Qualities per item).

#### Close-fitting (armour or headpiece)
A skillful smith has made this piece of protective equipment
more difficult to overcome with a piercing blow.

The selected item’s Protection rating gets a bonus of +1.

This upgrade may be applied to any suit of armour or
helm, and can be selected multiple times (always up to a
maximum of 3 Qualities per item).

#### Reinforced (shield, unique)
The shield’s structure is reinforced, possibly with a metal
rim or a larger iron boss, letting its wearer parry blows
with greater ease.

The shield’s Parry bonus is raised by 1. In addition, the
shield cannot be smashed.

This upgrade may be applied only once, to any type of
shield (buckler, shield or great shield).

#### Grievous (weapon, unique)
The weapon is strong and heavy, inflicting more harm on
its targets.

The weapon’s Damage rating is raised by 2 (a weapon that
can be wielded with one or two hands gets the bonus to
both its Damage ratings).

This upgrade may be applied only once, to any one weapon.

#### Keen (weapon, unique)
Sharp and well-balanced, this weapon is more likely to
produce a piercing blow when hitting its target.

The weapon’s Edge rating is reduced by 1 (note that an
Edge rating of ![gandalf](assets/images/gandalf.png "Gandalf") becomes a rating of 10).

This upgrade may be applied only once, to any one
weapon type.

#### Fell (weapon, unique)
Hard and straight, a piercing blow from a fell weapon is
stopped less easily by a suit of armour.

The weapon’s Injury rating is raised by 2.

This upgrade may be applied only once, to any one
weapon type.
